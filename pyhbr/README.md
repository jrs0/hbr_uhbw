# Python Package for Tool/Model Development

This package will contain all the data analysis, model development, and other utilities developed as part of the BHF HBR project.

Do all installation/development work inside a virtual environment:

* On Linux, create and activate it using `python3 -m venv venv` and `. venv/bin/activate`
* On Windows (in VS Code), type Ctrl-Shift-P, run `Python: Create Environment...`, pick `Venv`, and ensure that it is activated (look for something like `3.11.4 ('.venv': venv)` in the bottom right corner of your screen)

You can install this package in editable mode (which will make the installation track live edits to this folder) by changing to this folder and running

```bash
pip install -e .
```
