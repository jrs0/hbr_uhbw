# Intended Purpose

The purpose of the tool is to help clinicians identify the relative risks of bleeding outcomes and ischaemic outcomes for patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), for the purpose of choosing between different therapy options.

For example, if a patient is identified as being at a high risk of bleeding, the the clinician could use this information to choose a less aggressive blood thinning therapy option.

In addition to providing risks on request, the tool should also notify relevant health care professionals if the risks change enough to warrant a change in therapy at any point in a monitoring period.

The tool should be easy enough to use that it can be incorporated into routine clinical practice. This includes not requiring the user to source a large quantity of information required to produce the relative risks.

* **Who will use the tool**: clinicians or other health care professionals involved in the assessment of what blood thinning therapy to prescribe to a patient
* **When will the tool be used**: when a patient presents with an ACS, and blood thinning therapy is indicated. In addition, any time the risks change and a relevant health-care professional is notified in the monitoring period.
* **What output will the tool give**: any output that indicates a patient's relative bleeding/further ischaemia risk. This could be probabilities from a model, or a simple high/low indicator based on a simple consensus-based calculation. The output from the tool will be decided by choosing from a list of alternative solutions according to (in order of importance):
    * which one best meets the intended purpose
    * which one is simplest to implement
