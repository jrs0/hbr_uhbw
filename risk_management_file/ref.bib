	abstract = {Background The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores have been used to evaluate Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) severity in clinical settings. Through the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision Code (ICD-10), documentation of NIHSS scores has been made possible for administrative purposes and has since been increasingly adopted in insurance claims. Per CMS guidelines, the stroke ICD-10 diagnosis code must be documented by the treating physician, but ICD-10 NIHSS scores can be documented by any healthcare provider involved in the patient{\textquoteright}s care. Accuracy of the administratively collected NIHSS compared to expert clinical evaluation as documented in the Paul Coverdell registry is however still uncertain.Methods Leveraging a linked dataset comprised of the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program (PCNASP) clinical registry and probabilistically matched individuals on Medicare Claims data, we sampled patients aged 65 and above admitted for AIS across nine states, from 2016 to 2019. We excluded those lacking documentation for either clinical or ICD-10 based NIHSS scores. We then examined score concordance from both databases and measured discordance as the absolute difference between the PCNASP and ICD-10-based NIHSS scores.Results Among 66,837 matched patients, mean NIHSS scores for PCNASP and Medicare ICD-10 were 7.26 (95\% CI: 7.20 {\textendash} 7.32) and 7.40 (95\% CI: 7.34 {\textendash} 7.46), respectively. Concordance between the two scores was high as indicated by an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.93.Conclusion The high concordance between clinical and ICD-10 NIHSS scores highlights the latter{\textquoteright}s potential as measure of stroke severity derived from structured claims data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the NIH (1R01AG073410-01)Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Our study adhered to the ethical guidelines outlined by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB) and obtained IRB approval under the protocol number 2020P003963I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

abstract = {Abstract Quantitative assessment of modeling and forecasting of continuous quantities uses a variety of approaches. We review existing literature describing metrics for forecast accuracy and bias, concentrating on those based on relative errors and percentage errors. Of these accuracy metrics, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is one of the most common across many fields and has been widely applied in recent space science literature and we highlight the benefits and drawbacks of MAPE and proposed alternatives. We then introduce the log accuracy ratio and derive from it two metrics: the median symmetric accuracy and the symmetric signed percentage bias. Robust methods for estimating the spread of a multiplicative linear model using the log accuracy ratio are also presented. The developed metrics are shown to be easy to interpret, robust, and to mitigate the key drawbacks of their more widely used counterparts based on relative errors and percentage errors. Their use is illustrated with radiation belt electron flux modeling examples.},
