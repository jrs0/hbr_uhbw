  **Aim** To estimate the risks of severe bleeding and further ischaemic events within 12 months using routine electronic health data available at the time of hospital admission.

  **Methods** Data is obtained for {{ num_index_spells }} ACS or PCI admissions between {{ index_start }} and {{ index_end}} from a major public hospital in South West England. Estimated risks are calculated through Machine Learning (ML) techniques: Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, etc. A total {{ num_features }} possible explanatory variables are considered using data from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), supplemented with local hospital laboratory test data and personal attribute data from primary care. Model accuracy is assessed through area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

  **Results** For predicting bleeding events, accuracy is in the range of {{ worst_bleeding_model_auc }} ({{ worst_bleeding_model_name }}) to {{ best_bleeding_model_auc }} ({{ best_bleeding_model_name }}), with xx, xx and xx being the most important explanatory variables in the best model. For predicting further ischaemic events, accuracy is in the range of {{ worst_ischaemia_model_auc }} ({{ worst_ischaemia_model_name }}) to {{ best_ischaemia_model_auc }} ({{ best_ischaemia_model_name }}), with xx, xx and xx being the most important explanatory variables in the best model. 

  **Discussion** The xxx and yyy models appear to offer the best statistical power for predicting adverse events following ACS using routine electronic health data. While the hospital is sufficiently large in accommodating a diverse range of patient and condition, further research should consider the extent to which results hold in other external settings.
