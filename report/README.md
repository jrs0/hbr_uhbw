# Run 30/09/2024

This run removes the stroke component from the ischaemia outcome
definition, and includes a the new ARC HBR score survival curves
in the report.

As a result of the new ischaemia definition, the ischaemia secondary
cut-off is reduced to 4. The bleeding secondary cut-off remains
at 10.
