### GENERAL ###

# Path to load data from and save data to.
save_dir: "../save_data"

# Base name for this analysis. The string "_data" is
# appended to this name to create the file to load. This
# base name is also used as the prefix for saved files.
analysis_name: "icb_hic"

### DATASET GENERATION ###

# Raw date ranges (yyyy-mm-dd) to restrict the
# SQL data fetch. HIC data only goes back to
# Nov 2019, so set window a bit before that to
# catch everything. End date can be set in the
# future to catch most recent data. Date ranges
# will be automatically restricted to allow a
# window on each side of the index events for
# patient history and outcomes.
start_date: "2019-1-1"
end_date: "2025-1-1"

# Set the name of the ICD-10 and OPCS-4 codes files
# that will be used to define features and outcome
# code groups. The file will be loaded from the
# pyhbr package.
icd10_codes_file: "icd10_arc_hbr.yaml"
opcs4_codes_file: "opcs4_arc_hbr.yaml"

# Set the ACS and PCI code group names that will define
# index events. Events will be considered an ACS event
# if an ACS ICD-10 code is found in the primary position
# of the first episode of the spell. Secondary diagnoses
# are ignored to remove the possibility of identifying
# historical events. PCI index events allow a PCI code
# in any primary or secondary position of the first
# episode of the spell, on the assumption that a coded
# secondary procedure in an episode implies that the
# procedure was performed in that episode.
acs_index_code_group: "acs_bezin"
