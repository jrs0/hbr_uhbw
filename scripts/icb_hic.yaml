### GENERAL ###

# Path to load data from and save data to.
save_dir: "../save_data"

# Base name for this analysis. The string "_data" is
# appended to this name to create the file to load. This
# base name is also used as the prefix for saved files.
analysis_name: "icb_hic"

### DATASET GENERATION ###

# Raw date ranges (yyyy-mm-dd) to restrict the
# SQL data fetch. HIC data only goes back to
# Nov 2019, so set window a bit before that to
# catch everything. End date can be set in the
# future to catch most recent data. Date ranges
# will be automatically restricted to allow a
# window on each side of the index events for
# patient history and outcomes.
start_date: "2019-1-1"
end_date: "2025-1-1"

# Set the name of the ICD-10 and OPCS-4 codes files
# that will be used to define features and outcome
# code groups. The file will be loaded from the
# pyhbr package.
icd10_codes_file: "icd10_arc_hbr.yaml"
opcs4_codes_file: "opcs4_arc_hbr.yaml"

# Set the ACS and PCI code group names that will define
# index events. Events will be considered an ACS event
# if an ACS ICD-10 code is found in the primary position
# of the first episode of the spell. Secondary diagnoses
# are ignored to remove the possibility of identifying
# historical events. PCI index events allow a PCI code
# in any primary or secondary position of the first
# episode of the spell, on the assumption that a coded
# secondary procedure in an episode implies that the
# procedure was performed in that episode.

### MODELLING ###


# Test/train split
test_proportion: 0.25

# All randomness is derived from this seed.
seed: 0

# Using a larger number of bootstrap resamples will make
# the stability analysis better, but will take longer to fit.
num_bootstraps: 10

# Choose the number of bins for the calibration calculation.
# Using more bins will resolve the risk estimates more
# precisely, but will reduce the sample size in each bin for
# estimating the prevalence.

      The risk estimate is an average over decision trees, each of which
      estimates the risk by recursively dividing the input predictors into
      ranges and estimating the prevalence within each range of inputs. 100
      trees are used, and each tree is capped at a depth of 10 to avoid overfitting.
