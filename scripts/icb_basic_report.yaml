    abbr: "RF"
    description: >
      The risk estimate is an average over decision trees, each of which
      estimates the risk by recursively dividing the input predictors into
      ranges and estimating the prevalence within each range of inputs. 100
      trees are used, and each tree is capped at a depth of 10 to avoid overfitting.
  logistic_regression:

    title: "Logistic Regression"
    abbr: "LR"
    description: >
       The risk is obtained by fitting the logistic regression model to the events,
       using the input features are variables. A penalty term is added to handle
       collinearity of the predictors and to penalize overfitting.

    description: >
      An alternative tree-based method, similar to random forest, that uses a
      different algorithm to obtained train the model.
