  Patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes, such as those who undergo percutaneous coronary
  intervention for myocardial infarction, are often placed on dual antiplatelet therapy to mitigate
  the risk of further ischaemic events. However, care must be taken to avoid causing severe bleeding
  complications in patients who are at high bleeding risk. Tools that estimate both the bleeding and
  ischaemia risk would be valuable to cardiologists, especially given the rareness of bleeding complications,
  and the complex mix of factors that influences risk.
  We present the performance of several machine learning classification algorithms to estimate
  bleeding and ischaemic risk, using input features from hospital episode statistics and primary care data.
  Model stability is assessed by bootstrap resampling the training set, retraining the models, and assessing
  how consistently the bootstrapped models agree on risk estimates. Accuracy is assessed by the model
  calibration, which compares the model-estimated risk with an estimate of the outcome prevalence in model-defined
  risk groups.
