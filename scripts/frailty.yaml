### GENERAL ###

# Path to load data from and save data to.
save_dir: "../save_data"

# Base name for this analysis. The string "_data" is
# appended to this name to create the file to load. This
# base name is also used as the prefix for saved files.
analysis_name: "frailty"

### DATASET GENERATION ###

# Raw date ranges (yyyy-mm-dd) to restrict the
# SQL data fetch. HIC data only goes back to
# Nov 2019, so set window a bit before that to
# catch everything. End date can be set in the
# future to catch most recent data. Date ranges
# will be automatically restricted to allow a
# window on each side of the index events for
# patient history and outcomes.
start_date: "2019-1-1"
end_date: "2025-1-1"

# Set the name of the ICD-10 and OPCS-4 codes files
# that will be used to define features and outcome
# code groups. The file will be loaded from the
# pyhbr package.
icd10_codes_file: "icd10_arc_hbr.yaml"
opcs4_codes_file: "opcs4_arc_hbr.yaml"

# Define the code group that is used to identify index
# events (STEMI, and unstable angina)
acs_index_code_group: "acs_bezin"

# Set code groups to identify which index presentations
# are STEMI/NSTEMI (others not in either group are 
# unstable angina)
stemi_index_code_group: "mi_stemi_schnier"

      # no events fof the group cv_death_ohm (cardiac 
      # arrest appears to only ever be recorded in a

      # position is allowed, in an attempt to restrict

      # another cause.
